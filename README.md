# PocketMicroLIB
PocketMicroLIB – Practical MicroPython libraries for GNSS &amp; LTE IoT devices

This library is designed primarily for MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico-class boards.
No Python package installation is required.
Simply copy the .py files to the root of the device.

- Files prefixed with `micro_` are generic infrastructure modules.
- Files without the prefix are device-specific implementations.
